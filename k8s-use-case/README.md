# Kubernetes Use Case

You will have to deploy a small Node.js app on Kubernetes from scratch.

The application source code and instructions to build and run it are available in [this README file](https://github.com/oui-team/devops-interview/tree/master/app).

What you need to produce:

- A Dockerfile to build the application
- A manifest to deploy the app (you may pick your own: Kubernetes, Helm, â€¦)
- A precise documentation of every component you will use
- A _description_ of the complete CI/CD tooling you will use to deploy
- A successful and working deployment on Kubernetes
- An ingress and service that route incoming traffic to our application

We provide an external static IP address. We will send you the IP address and a domain name resolving to this IP.

We will pay extra attention to:

- Your Dockerfile
- How you handle configuration
- Your choices regarding deployment tools and monitoring
- Your manifests formats (helm, terraform, raw, ..)
- The scaling capabilities of your deployment

A Kubernetes cluster is available to deploy your app. You may use Docker Hub or any publicly accessible container registry to publish your image.

### Bonus

We would like to make sure that the app is accessible securely using the ingress. So if you still have time:

- The deployed ingress should only allow whitelisted IP addresses. You can pick an IP range of your choice. Note that the ingress controller deployed in the cluster is [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/).
- Secure your app with a certificate, you can use LetsEncrypt. A [LetsEncrypt certificate ClusterIssuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) is already deployed, its name is `letsencrypt-prod`.
